Maintaining liquidity, or the ability to pay for cash requirements, is critical for both corporate and retail clients. Furthermore, lending is one of the revenue generators for banks, which implies that banks must correct this. Lending will eventually become easier with blockchain technology because transactions will be settled instantly. This feature can help in avoiding issues like duplicate spending and defaulting. Blockchain technology can cut the time to open a bank account from days to minutes.</p>
